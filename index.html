          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            Since I was a kid, I have always wanted to build things. Whether it
            was a fort in the woods with my grandfather or a LEGO spaceship, I
            have always known and coveted that feeling of being able to step
            back, take a look at something, and say: "I made that."
          </p>
          <p>
            As I got older, my drive to create found its medium in songs and
            stories, and with it I built recordings and novels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even as I moved into retail work, what I made with my own hands was
            what made me feel fulfilled - the clean counters and organized
            coolers; the oranges and apples stacked just so; the filled shelves
            and detailed planograms.

          <h3><strong>Aspirations</strong></h3>
          <p>
            While working at a high-end grocery store as a produce buyer, I was
            frequently frustrated by the antiquated, manual pen and paper system
            used to order product. We didn't usually make margin as a
            department, and this was generally accepted by upper management as
            attributable to the notoriously difficult task of buying such a
            shrinkable product as fresh produce. I thought there had to be a
            better way. Having never been interested in programming in the past,
            I bought a book about the C language. I created a simple program in
            C that took our data based on past sales, our predictions for future
            sales, accounted our shrink and budget, and would effectively tell
            us what to order for the next day. We finally began making margin
            with regularity. Although I ended up replicating the algorithms in
            Excel, I had gotten my first taste in the creative power of
            programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you told a younger me that I would be interested in programming,
            younger me would be astounded. But after taking Front End Web
            Development and SQL/ETL with Albany Can Code, I've realized the
            creative power of code to provide solutions that are not only
            satisfying to clients or end-users, but to the programmers
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to hone and expand my coding knowledge and combine it with my
            creative strengths in a workplace that allows me to look at a
            project, step back, and again say: "I made that."
